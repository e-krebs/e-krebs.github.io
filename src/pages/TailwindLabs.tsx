            <p className="lead">First, let me tell you where I come from.</p>

            <p>
              <div className="text-6xl md:text-9xl float-left md:float-right flex flex-col gap-6 py-6 pr-3 md:pr-0 md:pl-3">

              Software developer is not my first career. I originally pursued a career in scientific
              research in Theoretical Chemistry (you should be able to find scientific papers if
              you‚Äôre curious) with a classic journey: PhD (technically I‚Äôm Dr Krebs) then PostDoc.
              <br />
              What I liked was being able to apply theoretical concepts to understand & sometimes
              solve actual problems.
              <br />
              Those years were very formative and developed skills which still influence how I work
              today, notably organization & forward thinking (I‚Äôve been told it can be seen on my
              face when I pause for thinking).
              <br />
              Unfortunately, scientific research is quite a crowded field which led me, after a not
              so successful PostDoc, to reconsider my career choices. And so I started my journey as
              a Software Engineer in 2012.
            </p>

            <p className="lead">
              Fast forward today, I‚Äôm a 41 year old Software Engineer, living just outside Paris
              (France) with my wife and our young kid. And I am lucky enough to both have a nice
              Home Office and enjoy working remotely (my current team spans from CET to Mountain
              Time Zone).
            </p>

              My journey in development actually started way before I even considered a carrier in
              the field.
              <br />
              When I was a chemistry student (and later in PostDoc), I was an avid wargame player
              which led me to build my first websites to build army lists (javascript + notepad &
              later Google Web Toolkit).
              <br />
              During my PhD I also discovered the joy and power of scripting for automatically
              extracting data from files and avoiding human mistakes.

              </div>
              In early 2012 I had the opportunity to follow a training for developers on Microsoft
              technologies, which led me to spend the next 7 years working in a small french service
              company. I learned a lot during those 7 years, working for many different types of
              clients, and grew from being a Junior Software Engineer to being a Software Architect
              with a ton of experiences.
              <br />
              Most of my work was using .NET, C# and Azure, but I also got to do mobile development.
              The key skills I acquired during that time are adaptability & relentlessness: I had to
              dig many large codebases hunting weird bugs, often without proper tooling, sometimes
              in programming languages I was not familiar with (VB, objective-c, Silverlight and
              later ruby).
            </p>

            <p className="lead">
              In 2019 I joined Algolia where I worked in a few teams over the last 5 years.
              <br />
              I‚Äôve been the technical leader (mostly for frontend) of my teams for more than 4
              years.

                  className="m-3 max-w-12 max-h-12 md:max-w-24 md:max-h-24"
                  width={96}
                  height={96}
                />
              </div>
              Initially I was developing internal tools, either our internal admin or custom tools
              for non-technical colleagues.
              <br />
              One of the most successful ones is a no-code tool that allows you to build custom
              demos for prospects through a few forms and some Drag & Drop. Under the hood it relied
              on some json configuration which allowed me to easily add new templates.
            </p>

            <p>
              For the past two years I‚Äôve been in the team that is owning the Merchandising Studio.
              It's the first new UI that has been built at Algolia since the classic Dashboard many
              years ago. When I joined that team we were 2 people (PM and me) and the whole project
              was just an idea. Now we are 9 with a live and successful product.
            </p>

              </div>
              Even though most of what I‚Äôve been doing at Algolia is geared toward not-so-technical
              users (both internal & external), I developed a passion for Developer Experience. This
              ranges from working on tests (building test helpers, introducing patterns & best
              practices, migrating thousands of tests) to becoming both a React & Typescript expert.
            </p>

            <p className="lead">
              I also enjoy transmitting all the skills I acquired over time, be it through public
              speaking, pairing with colleagues or proper mentoring.

              I am honestly not looking for a job at the moment, but working at Tailwind Labs looks
              too much like a dream job to me to ignore it: a small team, some open source,
              successful and impactful projects for developers and what seems to be great working
              conditions.
